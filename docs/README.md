# Documentation Index

## Authority

- [`ProjectDescription.md`](ProjectDescription.md) is the normative product
  specification and poker-rule authority.
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the authoritative implementation
  design. It may refine structure but cannot change the product rules.

## Current task index

This is the single entry point for active work. Follow the first unchecked task
in the selected backlog unless the user explicitly selects another task or
section. Keep completion evidence and checkboxes in the owning backlog.
- [`RestructureGuiTasks.md`](RestructureGuiTasks.md) — proposed GUI replacement:
  unified geometry/classification, pure presentation models, component scenes,
  themes and container-owned responsive layouts. First task: RG-00 baseline.
- [`MinimumRaiseTasks.md`](MinimumRaiseTasks.md) — implement street-local
  minimum full-raise increments in core and verify legal raise presentation
  and submission in GUI and CLI. First task: MR-00 baseline and boundary rules.

## Archived task records

- [`arkiv/OptimizingPhoneGuiTasks.md`](arkiv/OptimizingPhoneGuiTasks.md) — historical
  phone review and acceptance evidence; open recorded device checks are not
  completed by archive placement or automated gates.
- [`arkiv/LanTestTasks.md`](arkiv/LanTestTasks.md) — completed LAN workflow;
  user accepted resolution limitations. Current commands live in the
  [LAN how-to](../devdocs/how-to/local-wifi-web-testing.md).
- [`arkiv/OptimizingDesktopGuiTasks.md`](arkiv/OptimizingDesktopGuiTasks.md) —
  implementation tasks checked; exact hosted measurements and visual acceptance
  were not recorded. Archive placement does not certify acceptance.
- [`arkiv/OptimizingIpadTasks.md`](arkiv/OptimizingIpadTasks.md) — historical
  physical iPad acceptance, limited to its recorded evidence.

Local screenshots and logs under ignored `localtmp/` are session evidence,
not portable repository artifacts. Missing local captures cannot be recreated
as historical evidence; retain their recorded names and limitations.

## Specifications, runbooks, and guides

- [`Simulation_And_Evolutionary_Bot_Strategy.md`](Simulation_And_Evolutionary_Bot_Strategy.md)
  — simulation manifest/report contract, metrics, privacy, and profile
  evolution, including curated-roster baseline export.
- [Preparing and comparing bot experiments](../devdocs/how-to/preparing-bot-experiments.md)
  — strict configuration, generated manifests, compatible cohorts and pending review.
- [`POKERCARDS_IN_CLI.md`](POKERCARDS_IN_CLI.md) — interactive CLI card text
  format.
- [`OPTIONAL_WEB_SETUP.md`](OPTIONAL_WEB_SETUP.md) — automatic `main`-branch
  Web publishing and optional hosted browser/device verification runbook.
- [`ProvisionalGUILayoutGuidance.md`](ProvisionalGUILayoutGuidance.md) —
  provisional responsive Godot GUI guidance consistent with the architecture.
- [`GUI_VISUAL_TESTING.md`](GUI_VISUAL_TESTING.md) — canonical GUI viewport and
  state fixtures, screenshot evidence, review, and local gate workflow.
- [`templates/GUI_DEFECT.md`](templates/GUI_DEFECT.md) — standard record for GUI
  visual, layout, reachability, and hosted-presentation defects.

## Archived history

[`arkiv/`](arkiv/) preserves superseded plans and completed task history,
including the completed core, CLI, GUI, simulation, and release-readiness
backlogs and the accepted iPad optimization record. Its files are historical
evidence, not active requirements or backlogs.
